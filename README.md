# SkyrimLikeHands
Made in Godot 3.2

Inspired by Skyrim I made an animated 3 model of hands in Blender and developed this first person controller. It is a good starting point for a combat game. The player can look around and cast ice or fire, for a small demonstration watch the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhs1oTytff0&t=4s . You are free to use this project however you want, even in commercial projects.
